# Typographer

There comes a time in the life of every decent webmaster when he seriously thinks about screen typography.

On the one hand, he wants the typed text to look good in the browser window. And to do this, instead of signs of the inch to put a normal quote (“herringbone” and “feet”), to kill the extra space, in the right places to change the hyphens into hyphens, unbroken space “tied” all the short conjunctions and prepositions to follow them to words and make a bunch of other operations. On the other hand, do not really want to put all these icons, quotation marks and non-breaking spaces by hand.

Lebedev Studio was the first on the Internet to declare the importance of using on-screen typography in the layout of materials. Since 2000, the texts of all websites created by Lebedev Studio are put in order with the help of “Typographer”. Since 2002 the program has been available on our site for free.

You can read more about the principles of screen typography in [§ 62](https://www.artlebedev.ru/kovodstvo/sections/62/) “Guidelines”.
